# This is my first ever javascript project!

In this project, I'm trying to create document uploading system that is connected to a python script to print the document.
The python script is made by my friend @ariqathallah38 for a youtube video.

I'm doing this project before I learn any Javascript framework and while learning about webpack (that's why you will be able to see webpack config even though it's kinda messy)


## This project is fully working in local network
Linux usage guide
1. Clone this project
2. Open the project directory
3. In terminal, npm install
4. If you want to deploy it yourself, npm run build, use the dist directory and barebone.py
   If you want to run it in local network, npm run mulai
   
If you want to deploy it in non local network, use the above guide and expose the port that is used by express to the internet.
If you don't know how to do it, you can use free port forwarding service such as ngrok (but it's not blazing fast)

NEXT MILESTONE : Create drag'n'drop system
